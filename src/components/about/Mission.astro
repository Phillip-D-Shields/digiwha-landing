              We're not just another digital marketing agency – we're your local Tasman neighbors who understand the unique rhythm of our region. From the seasonal tourism peaks in Abel Tasman to the harvest cycles of our orchards, we know when your business needs to amplify its voice and when to optimize for quieter periods.
            </p>
            <p class="text-primary-950/70 dark:text-primary-200/70 text-base sm:text-lg">
              Based in the heart of Motueka, we believe in the power of face-to-face connections. While we leverage cutting-edge digital tools, we prefer meeting over coffee at a local café to understand your business goals. This personal approach allows us to create marketing strategies that truly reflect your brand's personality and connect with your community.
            </p>
            <p class="text-primary-950/70 dark:text-primary-200/70 text-base sm:text-lg">
              Our seasonal pricing model reflects our understanding of local business cycles. We know tourism operators need aggressive campaigns in spring preparation and peak summer support, while agricultural businesses require different timing aligned with planting and harvest schedules. This flexibility ensures you get maximum impact when you need it most, without breaking the budget during quieter periods.
